# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

## Description
This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Advent of Code is an annual December event where participants are presented with a daily coding challenge. Each day typically involves solving two problems: a primary problem and a more complex follow-up.

## Structure
The solutions are organized by day inside `src` directory, with each day's challenge in its own file:
- `day1.rb`
- `day2.rb`
- ...

## Technologies
These solutions are implemented using Ruby.

## How to Use
- Each directory contains the solution for that day along with any input data necessary.

## Contribution
Suggestions and improvements are welcome via pull requests.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are for educational purposes and to share coding practices and approaches. Please use them responsibly.
